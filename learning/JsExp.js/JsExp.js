// Hoisting => means that if the variable declared Js takes an attendence of the same var and maintain in its variables register.
//             then from that register it will compare if the var consoled before or (above the declaration in code) the initialisation then the same var will be 
//             registered with a value of undefined.

// Shadowing => means that same variable name is declared inside a function then that variable 
// will be undefined until and unless the var defined inside that function.
